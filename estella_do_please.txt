Hello Estella (and Jacob). These are the things Nabil and I need you to do for the fornt end :)

- Styling LHS of search page (all the search fields and inputs)
- Index page (buttons and Welcome font and stuff like that)
- My Dashboard (headings, font inside boxes)
- About page (all of it)
- Error messages (flashes) that user is given as warning prompts. 
    - This happens in things like registering, logging in
    - Currently appears at the top of the page, above background image

Thank you :)
Ps. Will keep adding to this when we discover more stuff and/or break stuff
